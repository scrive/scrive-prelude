## Releases

To release a new version of the `scrive-prelude` library, create a git tag, and a Release on the GitHub interface.
The Release allows for a short changelog to be included in the description, which is helpful for downstream consumers
to see if a fix or an addition have been included.

When the release is created, please post the link on `#devel-haskell`.
